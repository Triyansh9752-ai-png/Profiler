    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Triyansh, an 18-year-old tech enthusiast and adventure seeker from the heart of India. I thrive on exploring new trails‚Äîboth digital and real-world. Whether it‚Äôs climbing rugged hills, writing lines of code, or cracking complex network setups, I love pushing boundaries and learning something new every day.</p>
    
    <p>Technology is my playground. I specialize in creating secure VPN tunnels, routing internet traffic through powerful VPS systems, and deploying fast, reliable content delivery using CDN platforms like Apache, Bunny, Fastly, Nginx, Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, and Microsoft. I‚Äôm all about performance, security, and smart solutions that make digital life smoother and stronger.</p>
    
    <p>Outside the tech realm, I‚Äôm all about speed, freedom, and discovery. I love bike riding‚Äîfeeling the wind, the road, and the adrenaline rush. I'm fond of cars, especially those with raw power and style. Traveling is a passion of mine‚ÄîI dream of exploring every corner of the world, experiencing cultures, and creating unforgettable memories. From road trips across the Himalayas to sunsets in Santorini, my bucket list is full and growing.</p>
    
    <p>I‚Äôm also someone who enjoys sharing knowledge. Whether it‚Äôs guiding a beginner or brainstorming with pros, I believe in collaboration and community. Helping others grow fuels my own growth too.</p>
    
    <p>I completed my schooling at Maharishi Vidya Mandir, where the seeds of my  journey were first sown‚Äîand since then, I‚Äôve been on a ride of curiosity, creation, and constant learning.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> "Life's a journey‚Äîwhether it's trekking through mountains or exploring the depths of the internet."</p>
    <p><strong>Thought:</strong> üìúüïâÔ∏è "Walking the path of Dharma, guided by Krishna's flute."</p>
